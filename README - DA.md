# Air_Quality_Prediction
Using historical Air Quality data from AirNow to predict the AirQuality for next days.

For this analysis, we will be narrowing in on an ideal machine learning model as we process the data. The first step will be cleaning the data, then we will play with different target variables, to see which yield the most interesting results. Our first approach will be to pull in neural network models, to include a wide array of variables, and vary the outcome. Very similar code can be used to quickly address many options using largely the same code. Random forest and deep learning models will be tested.

If we do not find an outcome with strong predictions using neural networks, we can aggregate the variables more manually using a PCA, and use a supervised learning model.
