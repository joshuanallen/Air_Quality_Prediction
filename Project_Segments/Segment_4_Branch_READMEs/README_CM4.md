# Presentation Script
1. Slide 1:
Hello Everyone, 

Our project is Air Quality Prediction
The Effects of Pollution on California’s Socioeconomic Indicators

The members of this team are 
David
Josh
Ashley
And myself, Cynthia

2. Slide 2:
So WHEN we formed this group we wanted to pick a topic that was close to home, something we all cared for and had witnessed its impact first hand. 

So when realized we all lived in the bay area 
That is when we decided that devoting our project to understanding the impact of air quality in California      was something we felt called to do. 

Once we established a topic we went in search of a database and found data from California’s Environmental Protection Agency 
So we focused on the census tract in California as a variable that could help us understand if there is a correlation between Air quality variables, health and economic outcomes in California's population. 

Once the topic and data were in place we create a hypothesis:

3. Slide 3:
Our hypothesis is asking 

If Air quality data points for a given geographic location CAN ACCURATELY PREDICT health and economic outcomes for that area
And the Null hypothesis:  Is that we CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT outcomes for that area.
From that point forward we drew a road map of how we wanted to test our hypothesis.

In this presentation we will go over what we used, 
how we managed data, 
applications, 
our findings 
and visualizations of our results. 

Next up is David, which will explain the tools we used and data manipulation.
