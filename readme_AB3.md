## Presentation Script 

For our project we took our clean data and loaded it into Tableau in order to generate visuals and to tell a story.
 
So letâ€™s take a look at a few of the visuals that we were able to produce from the data. Here you can see that we chose some of our target variable data and some of the feature variables or environmental exposure indicators such as low birth weight and traffic, low birth weight and PM 2.5 and low birth weight and ozone. Each one of these visuals is interactive allowing you to filter the data.
 
Other variables chosen include asthma and PM 2.5 and Asthma and traffic. You can see that this does show that there is some correlations between asthma and PM 2.5 in certain regions of California, however asthma related emergency dept visits do not appear to be highly correlated with traffic in the state.
 
Here we have an image of a sample regression prediction plot that is an output from our model. While some of our data does show some correlations, which can be seen in some of the visuals, our model may need to be enhanced in order to directly predict target variables such as cardiovascular disease and now Josh will go over our machine learning model in more detail.
