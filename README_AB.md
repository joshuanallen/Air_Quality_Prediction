For our final project out team has decided to take air qaulity data from different coounties in California to predict 


# Team Members and Roles for Segment One: 
Josh Allen - Sqaure 
Cynthia Marin - Circle 
David Aronson - Triangle
Ashley Burneka - X 


# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard


X 
The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. How will the dashboard be built? All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

By the live session, submit a list of technologies you and your team intend to use for the project. Make sure to explain which technology is being used where (e.g., Pandas for data cleaning, Postgres for storage, etc.).
