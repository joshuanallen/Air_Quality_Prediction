# Segment 1 of Final Project 

## Tasks Completed in Segment 1: 

1. Decides on a topic for the project. 
2. Created a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
3. Sourced a dataset that will help us answer our queswtions.
4. Began to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on our dataset so that iw will be ready for analysis.
5. Created mockups of a machine learning model and a database.

# Team Members and Roles for Segment One: 
* Josh Allen - Sqaure 
* Cynthia Marin - Circle 
* David Aronson - Triangle
* Ashley Burneka - X 

### 1. Project Topic

For our final project our team has decided to take air qaulity data from different counties in California to test the following hypotheis: 

Hypothesis: The pollution exposure of different regions in California presents a negative socioeconomic effect on the population. 
Null Hypothesis: There is no negative correlation between pollution exposure and negative socioeconomic variables.  
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a negative correlation between pollution exposure and negative socioeconomic variables.  

Pollution Exposure Variables: 
Ozone Concentrations
PM2.5 Concentrations
Diesel PM Emissions
Drinking Water Contaminants
Pesticides Use
Toxic Release from Facilities
Traffic Density

Socioeconomic Variables: 
Educational Attainment
Housing Burdened Low Income Households
Linguistic Isolation
Poverty 
Unemployment 

Health Risk Variables: 
Asthma 

### 2. Repository 

The sqaure roll for segment 1 was tasked with creating a repository and 


Data Manipulation:
Python Clean-up and create databases
Upload to AWS
Google collab
Create tables with SQL
Tableau visualization 
Use R to prove hypothesis
Create Website to display findings
Dashboard 



# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Data Source: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/calenviroscreen-3-0-results/resource/89b3f4e9-0bf8-4690-8c6f-715a717f3fae

* Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis.
* Python and Jupyter Notebook for further analysis. 
* R will also be used to test our hypothesis. 

## Database Storage
XXX is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate XXX to display the data.

## Machine Learning

## Dashboard


X 
The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. How will the dashboard be built? All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

By the live session, submit a list of technologies you and your team intend to use for the project. Make sure to explain which technology is being used where (e.g., Pandas for data cleaning, Postgres for storage, etc.).
